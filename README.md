PolyGen
=======

A program for replicating images using polygons.

Instructions:

- Generating an image from scratch:

1) Place a JPEG named masterImage.jpg in the same directory as PolyGen.pde

2) Open started.txt and make sure it reads "0"

3) Open PolyGen.pde with Processing and hit Run

4) The applet will open and start generating your image, outputting an image file every 1000 steps

5) At any point, press the "s" key and the current "DNA" of your image will be saved

- Continuing an image using a DNA file

1) Make sure masterImage.jpg and dna.txt are in the same directory as PolyGen.pde and started.txt reads "1"

2) Open PolyGen.pde with Processing and hit Run. It should pick up where you left off

3) Pressing "s" while the applet is running will overwrite any previous saves with the current DNA
